VisualProjectHelper for visual studio coder
This is a tool specially written for Microsoft Visual Studio users. It is mainly used to help new beginners quickly learn new technologies (Directx/c++) or other open source libraries. It is mainly used to easily add additional header files or related library files, and include related Table of Contents; when new scholars learn a technology that they have no experience with, the first lesson is very important. They often know nothing at the beginning of learning. The first project is not compiled, either because it lacks libraries or introduces header files. , this will make beginners very frustrated and give up easily. The options for adding header files and libraries are hidden in each option. Adding the corresponding library location is a patient process. As an experienced person, I have quite the experience that it is necessary to write a tool to ease the difficulty of getting started. In addition, the tool also provides quick intermediate file cleanup and unified setting of output paths, which is of great help in keeping the size minimal and tidy. If you are new to C++ or looking for an efficient tool to keep your code clean, this tool is for you.
